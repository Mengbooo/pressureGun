# 😍Simple pressure gun script pressureGun
## 🍟Advantages:
- Applicable to most automatic rifles with falling trajectory and weapon recoil
- Applicable to most FPS games (such as CS2, PUBG, etc., but not necessarily applicable to APEX, Titanfall and other trajectory and stable FPS games)
- Just copy and paste in the GHUB configuration file to use (LGS is the same)
## 😶‍🌫️Note:
- You need to "run GHUB as administrator" when using it
- After configuration, you may need to restart GHUB to work, otherwise it may be available on the desktop but cannot be used normally in the game
## 🤯 Urgently needed to be improved:
- Currently only general trajectory is written, so generally speaking, it can improve your accuracy of about 10~15 rounds of continuous shooting, and different games and different weapons will have different effects
- Currently suitable for automatic rifles, the error is large for burst or single-shot rifles (Continuous/single-shot guns will make different degrees of crosshair center corrections based on the interval time——Continuous-shot guns are like this, you only need to consider bursts, but our automatic rifles have more to consider👺👺👺)
- Currently only the version suitable for GHUB/LGS is written (other gaming mice are not yet adapted)
- Currently it has not yet been adapted to different DPIs
- Currently there is no technical capability to detect different games and different guns in the game
